Add a custom linux driver on the VisionFive2 board.
======

In this article, we will see how we can introduce a custom driver on the linux kernel of the VisionFive2 board.Â 

Step 1: setup Debian on the VisionFive2 board.
------

Take your microSD card, download the image and Balena Etcherd and flash it. This step is straightforward. Then you can connect using user / starfive as password

Step 2: Download a specific linux kernel
------

By default, dynamic modules are disabled in the Debian image and we can't compile a kernel modules since the kernel file don't have a build folder. To address this issue, we can download another release that support dynamic modules. For this tutorial, we use the version ....

// TODO: Add code here

Step 3: Add the new kernel in the boot menu
------

Now that we have the new kernel downloaded on the board, the next step consit of placing the kernel in the /boot folder and add a new entry in the bootloader. 

// TODO: Add code here

Step 4: Reboot the board
------

Now you can reboot the board, in the bootloader menu press 3.


Step 5: Compiling and inserting the module
------

The last step consist of cloning the example kernel module we use in this tutorial and compile it. As a last step we need to add it in the kernel and it will work yay!
