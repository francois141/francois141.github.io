I am currently a C/C++ low latency engineer a HFT comany called Mathrix and my day to day job consists of improving our low latency trading platform.

Prior to that, I was a research assistant at EPFL, working in the DCSL Group on the [Miralis project](https://miralis-firmware.github.io) under the supervision of Edouard Bugnion and Timothy Roscoe. Prior to joining the DCSL Group, I worked as research assistant at ETH ZÃ¼rich in the EASL Group on the [Dirigent project](https://github.com/eth-easl/dirigent), under supervision of Professor Ana Klimovic. My academic and research interests lie at computer systems in general.

Recently, I had to write a new kernel driver on the VisionFive2 board and the process was quite tedious.  Therefore I wrote a tutorial on how to do it easily: [link to the tutorial](https://francois141.github.io/visionfive2-board-custom-kernel/)
