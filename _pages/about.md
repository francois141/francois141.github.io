I am currently a research assistant at EPFL, working in the DCSL Group under the supervision of Edouard Bugnion. In addition to my research assistant role, I am also pursuing my masterâ€™s thesis at EPFL. Prior to joining the DCSL Group, I worked in the EASL Group on the [Dirigent](https://github.com/eth-easl/dirigent) project, under supervision of Professor Ana Klimovic. My academic and research interests lie at computer systems in general.
